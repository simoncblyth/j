Hi Jilei, Guofu, Ziyan, Tao, Albert, 

As Guofu and Tao were not there and Ziyan had to 
go to another meeting half way through let me 
summarize our discussion this morning. 

Jilei agreed with adopting a hierarchy approach and avoiding the 
complicated hole subtraction. He also agreed that it would be 
better to simply keep the steel pillars within the vetoWater 
and not extend them down into the Tyvek and DeadWater.

However Jilei made the point that reducing the height of the pillars 
would require chopping the bottom off the steel pillars : 0.101 m 

   0.1m (DeadWater) + 0.001m (Tyvek)  

The code that describes these pillars (from Tao) is quite involved
so it is not immediately obvious how best to cut off the bottom 0.101m.

   ./Simulation/DetSimV2/CentralDetector/include/HBeamConstruction.hh
   ./Simulation/DetSimV2/CentralDetector/src/HBeamConstruction.cc

Simon suggests one way to do this would be to incorporate a configurable Z-scaling 
that would restrict the changes needed to hopefully only a few lines. The Z-scaling 
would allow reducing the height by 0.101m with a corresponding shift upwards to keep 
the top in the same place. 

Actually looking at a visualization of the bottom of the pillars 
(with old geometry, before DeadWater addition) 
it is apparent that the bottom cross pieces are poking into the concrete. 
So increasing the Z down-scaling to reduce the height by a bit more 
than 0.101m could avoid the pillars poking into the Tyvek+DeadWater.  

Regarding reducing the thickness of the DeadWater, a suggestion from Tao,
Jilei thought that Hao-Qi would not agree to that as it would make 
muon track lengths a bit different from reality.
